                <h2>Why We All Talk to Ourselves</h2>
                <p>Recently, I made a stupid mistake. I'm currently finishing my associate's degree and, in preparation to continue my education and obtain a bachelor's degree, I applied to a university. This university has two schools under the same umbrella, with very similar names. I intended to apply to one, but it turns out I applied to the other—the wrong school! Additionally, I realized after the fact that the university was too far for me to attend. I remember the voice in my head crystal clear: "I'm such an idiot. I'm so stupid. I messed up my whole future!" Despite having had enough time to manage my applications, I was particularly upset about missing the application deadline for my desired program at a separate, closer school. Now I face the prospect of having to take an entire semester off.</p>
                <p>We all talk to ourselves. This is known as "<strong>self-talk</strong>," the internal monologues and discussions we have with ourselves. It influences how we feel, how we act, and our overall psyche. You might be familiar with positive vs. negative self-talk, but did you know that our minds are not a single entity? Instead, they are comprised of separate, distinct "<strong>parts</strong>" or sub-personalities. This specific therapeutic approach, called the <strong>Internal Family Systems (IFS) Model</strong>, developed by <strong>Richard Schwartz</strong>, views these parts not as negative but merely as different aspects of ourselves with different roles and intentions. Even parts that seem harmful and disruptive are usually just a <strong>self-defense mechanism</strong>, aiming to protect us or serve a positive, albeit misguided, purpose. At the core of these parts is the "<strong>Self</strong>": our core, true essence that is inherently wise and compassionate. It is the "driver" of the car, so to speak. Sometimes, however, that car gets hijacked by other "parts":</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Exiles:</strong> Wounded or vulnerable parts. These are the parts of ourselves that carry pain, trauma, fear, and other emotions like them.</li>
                    <li><strong>Managers:</strong> These are more protective parts that aim to control our surroundings and stop Exiles from taking over.</li>
                    <li><strong>Firefighters:</strong> These are reactive parts that activate when Exiles take control. Although a firefighter can put out a fire, there is still harm done to the structure. Think of how you procrastinate to distract from the stress of a deadline.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I mentioned in my last post, Signal in the Dark, that part of my journey of self-discovery is seeking to <strong>integrate my fractured sense of identity</strong>. The first step is <strong>awareness</strong>—just learning that these parts exist. Through exploration, we can learn who these voices are, what triggers them, what soothes them, and how to manage them when they do manage to take over. The mistake I mentioned earlier was a great example of one of the most notorious, unhealthy, and damaging parts we all have: the <strong>Inner Critic</strong>. Usually manifesting as harsh self-judgment, negative self-talk, and constant fault-finding, it tends to come from past experiences, ingrained patterns/modes of thinking, or internalized messages (i.e., "I'm not good enough," etc.).</p>

                <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                    <p>The goal of this post, then, is to help you not just notice these voices, but to understand and integrate them.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <p>If you truly seek peace, if you want a clear sense of self, if you want to be the one driving the car, the journey begins the same way you treat a friend in need: by <strong>listening</strong>. We should all seek to be friends with ourselves, and once you listen and understand these voices, you can work with them instead of against them.</p>

                <hr class="section-divider">

                <h2>Introducing the "Voice Map" (2x2 Grid)</h2>
                <p>I'm probably not the only person who finds these voices chaotic, loud, and overwhelming. When left unexamined and unchallenged, these inner voices can wreak havoc on every aspect of our psyche. From destroying our self-esteem and causing anxiety and depression to disrupting our decision-making, there is true power in how we speak to ourselves. Negative inner parts can sabotage us in times of stress, decision-making, or even little day-to-day moments. Besides, how can you control or manage something if you don't even know it's there? This lack of awareness and control (letting the "Self" get usurped) often leads us to believe that there's something wrong with us, that we are broken, that everything is our fault, that we are hopeless or beyond saving, etc.</p>
                <p>This brings us to a need for a tool of some sort. We need some way to identify, assess, and challenge unhelpful inner voices while supporting the helpful ones. Next, I'll introduce a simple "map" that I personally find helpful in laying out the complexities of our inner world. I think there is something tangible that happens when we write. Our brain stops and processes as we actively think and put pen to paper. I encourage you to do this exercise on paper for that reason. It doesn't have to be pretty, and a simple piece of notebook paper will suffice. This "Voice Map" makes the abstract feel tangible by explicitly describing and identifying the separate parts of ourselves and determining their role and contribution. By doing this, we can have a helpful, healthy, and productive dialogue with ourselves.</p>

                <blockquote class="pull-quote">

                </blockquote>

                <p>To start, we will further refine those two main questions (role and contribution) and position them each on an axis. Another way to think of this is role as intent/function (protective vs. vulnerable), and contribution as expression/impact (disruptive/challenging vs. supportive/calming).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Horizontal Axis (X): "What is this part's main role?"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Left Side: "The Doers & Protectors"</strong> (Parts focused on action, safety, control)</li>
                            <li><strong>Right Side: "The Feelers & Essences"</strong> (Parts focused on emotions, vulnerability, core identity)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Axis (Y): "How is this part contributing right now?"</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Top Side: "Needs Support / Is Challenging"</strong> (Parts whose current methods are unhelpful or that carry pain)</li>
                            <li><strong>Bottom Side: "Offers Wisdom / Is Resourceful"</strong> (Parts that provide helpful guidance or positive qualities)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Next, we will name the four quadrants and their type of voice. I know this may seem confusing, but bear with me (I provide a visual example later that should make the concept clearer).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Quadrant 1: The Overwhelmed Protectors (Top-Left)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Type:</strong> These are the parts trying to keep you safe or productive, but doing so in an unhelpful or exhausting way. (e.g., The Fearful Perfectionist, The Procrastinator, The Self-Critic, The Anxious Planner, The People-Pleaser). They mean well, but their current strategy creates problems.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Quadrant 2: The Vulnerable Hearts (Top-Right)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Type:</strong> These are the parts that carry pain, sadness, shame, fear, or a sense of not being enough. They feel hurt or fragile. (e.g., The Small Hopeful Child, The Ashamed Teenager, The Lonely Part).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Quadrant 3: The Wise Guides & Allies (Bottom-Left)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Type:</strong> These are parts that function healthily, providing structure, boundaries, courage, or effective action. They are protective in a helpful way. (e.g., The Organized Planner, The Confident Achiever, The Assertive Boundary-Setter, The Calm Problem-Solver).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Quadrant 4: The Core Self & Resourced Spark (Bottom-Right)</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Type:</strong> This is your true essence—the calm, compassionate, curious Self—and parts that feel unburdened and naturally bring joy, creativity, or peace. (e.g., The Curious Observer, The Compassionate Witness, The Playful Spirit, The Creative Flow, The Inner Wisdom).</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My Personal Example: Mapping Your Own Voices</h2>
                <p>Now, let's take what I've described and put it into practice. We will use that example I gave at the beginning of the article, as it's fresh in my mind and I think a great illustration.</p>
                <p>Let me show you how I recently used this map to challenge those thoughts of being stupid, dumb, and incapable, as well as some other parts that I've noticed.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <p><strong>Filling in Your Map - Quadrant by Quadrant:</strong></p><p>For each quadrant/voice, describe:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>The Voice's Name/Role:</strong> What do you call it?</li>
                    <li><strong>What it Says or Feels:</strong> Give direct, candid examples of its typical statements or emotional expressions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Your Response / How You Work With It:</strong> Crucially, demonstrate how you engage with or reframe these voices. This is where the principles of <strong>detaching, labeling, identifying, separating, and planning action</strong> naturally come through your narrative.
                        <ul>
                            <li>For Q1/Q3: How did you <strong>name</strong> that voice to detach? How did you consciously <strong>reframe</strong> its negative messages? What action did you <strong>plan</strong> to counter it or leverage it?</li>
                            <li>For Q2/Q4: How did you offer compassion or reassurance to a wounded part, or listen to a hopeful one? What insights did it provide?</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>I'll be honest, that was a little difficult. But as all of these exercises go, they're meant to be uncomfortable, at least at first. As you repeat and keep doing it, it becomes more natural and intuitive. Knowing who we are talking to and who is talking to us can bring great clarity and comfort in moments of distress. Certainly, I feel less "on edge" and much more calm. I know that my mistake does not define me. Additionally, I learned and put a name to the helpful parts that don't get nearly enough attention, support, or "screen time."</p>

                <h2>Your Turn: Sketch & Share (Or Keep Private)</h2>
                <p>Well, reader, are you ready to bring your own inner voices into the light? Grab a sheet of paper (or whatever you use to write), draw a simple grid, and label the axes (X-Axis (Role): Doers & Protectors and Feelers & Essences; Y-Axis (Contribution): Needs Support & Offers Wisdom). Take a deep breath and keep an open mind. You can spend as little or as much time as feels natural. This isn't a test; no one's grading you, and there are no right or wrong answers.</p>
                <p>As you fill in each quadrant, ask yourself:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overwhelmed Protectors (Top-Left):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Which part of me pushes too hard or wears me down?"</li>
                            <li>"What voice yells at me to 'do more' or 'be perfect'?"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Vulnerable Hearts (Top-Right):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"What part feels fragile, ashamed, or unloved?"</li>
                            <li>"When do I notice the ache of not feeling enough?"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Wise Guides & Allies (Bottom-Left):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Which part calmly helps me set boundaries or make plans?"</li>
                            <li>"What voice encourages me to take small, manageable steps?"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Core Self & Resourced Spark (Bottom-Right):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>"Where do I feel my true, curious Self shining through?"</li>
                            <li>"What voice brings me joy, peace, or creative flow?"</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Like exercise, you likely won't see the most powerful benefits without repeated use. I think, short-term, it's a great way to understand and calm strong emotions, or reassure and strengthen positive ones. Long term, I think you can expect an increased level of <strong>self-awareness</strong> (strengthening your ability to identify the parts of yourself), less <strong>fragmentation</strong> (seeing the parts helps you reduce internal chaos), greater <strong>control</strong> (once you can identify the parts in the moment (naming and mapping) you have more power to choose which voices to follow) and most powerfully, it gives you a path to <strong>integration</strong>—honoring both protectors and vulnerable parts, moving toward inner harmony.</p>
                <p>I stress that there's no need to show anyone this—tuck it into your journal and revisit it anytime you feel overwhelmed. But if you are comfortable, feel free to share with your significant other, therapist, or whoever grounds and centers you. What surprised you? What felt healing or reassuring? How can your Self guide you next? I hope that this was informative, and that, at the very least, this article has encouraged you to think a little deeper about <strong>just who that voice is in your head</strong>.</p>
