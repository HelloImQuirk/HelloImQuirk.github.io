        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I go by Quirk online. I write to make sense of things — mostly myself.</p>

        <p>If there’s a throughline to this whole site, it’s that I’m trying to live with more intention than instinct. That means interrogating the parts of me that don’t work, owning what does, and being honest about the mess in between. I don’t have all the answers. But I take the questions seriously.</p>

        <p>Offline, I’m a full-time student and a husband before anything else. That relationship is the spine of my life — the one thing I always want to rise to. Everything else I do is, in some way, trying to become someone worthy of the people I love.</p>

        <p>I’ve struggled a lot. With identity, self-worth, discipline, appearance. With believing I have the right to take up space. But I don’t think I’m broken. Just unfinished. And maybe a little out of alignment with myself — but working on it.</p>

        <p>This site is where I track that work. Sometimes through essays. Sometimes through fiction. Sometimes through half-formed frameworks that feel like scaffolding for a life I haven’t built yet.</p>

        <p>If you're someone who overthinks things, wants better for yourself, and isn’t sure how to get there — welcome. I’m figuring it out, too.</p>
